**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**
PROJECT NAME: simple calculator

**Objectives:**
To Develop a simple calculator program in Python.Implement basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.Handle input errors and edge cases effectively.

**Key Points:**
1)User Interface: Display a menu with options for different arithmetic operations.
2)Input Handling: Accept user input for operation selection and numbers.
3)Operations: Perform the selected arithmetic operation and display the result.
4)Error Handling: Manage invalid inputs and specific cases like division by zero.

**Key Insights of the Project**
1)User-Centric Design:
    The project emphasizes creating a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and options for the user to choose from.
It highlights the importance of guiding the user through the process, reducing the likelihood of errors and enhancing the user experience.

2)Modular Code Structure:
    The use of functions for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) demonstrates good coding practices by promoting modularity and reusability. Each function handles a specific task, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

3)Input Validation and Error Handling:
    Implementing checks for valid numerical inputs and handling errors such as division by zero ensures that the calculator can handle a variety of user inputs gracefully.
The inclusion of exception handling (e.g., ValueError for invalid inputs) ensures that the program can manage unexpected situations without crashing, thereby enhancing its robustness.


**Roles & Responsibilities**
Project Developer:
1)Design and implement the command-line interface for user interaction.
2)Write functions for each arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
3)Implement input validation to handle non-numeric inputs and zero division errors.
4)Ensure the code includes appropriate error handling to catch and display relevant error messages.
5)Test the calculator with various inputs to ensure it functions correctly and handles errors as expected.

**Technologies used**
1)python programming language.

**Result:**
The result of this project is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations interactively. The calculator guides the user through selecting an operation, entering the required numbers, and displays the result. It handles invalid inputs and errors gracefully, providing a  user-friendly experience.![Screenshot 2024-06-23 164639](https://github.com/Praneeth140419/CODTECH-TASK-1/assets/172062525/d606f314-b33f-48a2-adb6-09258214a82b)
